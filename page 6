<p>When the government said it would ban second-hand clothes, it left many of us wondering how many other issues have not been addressed. Where will the thousands of traders who will be left without jobs go? Many youths have been killed on suspicion of engaging in crime, the recent slaughter of eight young men in Mukuru kwa Reuben, Nairobi, being an example. Joblessness has made many to join terrorist groups. Most families cannot afford the clothes the government wants us to buy. We are also not so sure if local factories will produce what citizens need.</p>
