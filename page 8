<p>The Media Council of Kenya is failing in its role. The council has the mandate of ensuring responsible journalism in media industry. But the case of Kenyaâ€™s broadcasting corporations incorporating comedians into the industry is alarming. The council is supposed to ensure only professionals host live shows on radios and televisions, professionals who have the knowledge and understanding of the code of conduct for the practice of journalism. This has not been the case with our many media house where comics have been bestowed with the power of entertaining listeners to an extent of forgetting the wide-range of their audience.</p>
