<p>Kenyan leaders play a prominent role at funerals. Burials commence only after they have made their speeches. They have discovered that they can gain political mileage at funerals; no wonder they usually attend many. They confess that they use their salary to help bereaved families but not to buy medication for patients. So, to a Kenyan politician, you are worth more dead than ill. Such people do not have the welfare of the people at heart.</p>
