<p>Primitive Habit
Talk of “voting for one of our own” is sickening and stale. Kenyans have perfected this primitive and retrogressive habit. People are forced to vote for a person from their communities without regard to leadership qualities. History has shown that having one’s tribesman in power does not translate to improved quality of life or service delivery. It takes the effort of a good leader to make life better. As the next elections nears, Kenyans should reject the perpetrators of the backward philosophy of “our” man or woman. Each aspirant must be chosen on the strength of his or her leadership capability not friendship or kinship. Leadership is too important to be treated casually.</p>
