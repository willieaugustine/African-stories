<p>The health of our children is important. Pneumonia, polio and measles continue to be some of the leading causes of high mortality rate. Vaccinating children against measles is a good move by the Ministry of Health as it helps to keep such disease at bay. I was once a victim of measles. It irritates the skin and the body itches uncomfortably. The Catholic Church is getting it wrong when it opposes such a significant activity. Its argument against the drugs doesnâ€™t serve the public interest. The drug has been approved by the World Health Organization and other international health bodies.</p>
